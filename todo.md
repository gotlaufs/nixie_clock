# TODOs for Nixie Clock project
Because no decent project is ever finished.

## HV PCBv2
- [ ] Input protection
    - [ ] Over/under-voltage
    - [ ] Reverse polarity
- [ ] Test points
- [ ] Bigger board
    - [ ] Better spacing
    - [ ] Better ground plane
- [ ] Maybe add 2.54mm compatible breakout pins for the MC34063 chip
- [ ] Pick more sane resistor values
- [ ] Fix MOSFET footprint
- [ ] Move connector header closer to board edge
